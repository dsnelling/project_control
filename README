== README for projectcontrol application.

An application to support tracking of status information and other supporting funcations for construction projects

(c) Duncan May-2011


A simple application to support on-line update and management of basic
data for construction projects. Data is indtended to be be kept updated
as various events happen, by the relevant persons, and the live status
visible by members of the project team.

Supports the following modules:
 - materials tracking by requisition and purchase contracts
 - upload and storage of key procurement documents
 - tracking of service requests
 - tracking of site manhours
 - upload and storage of incident reports
 - library for project forms and procedures (semi-static documents)
 - users require preassigned usernames and passwords for access
 - access to actions is controlled by assigning roles to users, and actions to roles


User interface is functional, not particularly athestically pleasing. No
specialist design skills have been employed (and I will be the first to admit
that it shows!). Suggestions welcome!

Upload uses Amazon S3. Credentials stored in environment variables.
